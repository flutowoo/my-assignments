# Take-Home Assignment: Chat Feature Integration

This task was developed with Android/Kotlin.

Please understand that the initial progress was carried out with SendBird UIKit because I didn't understand the contents of the assignment, but I revised it back to Chat API, so I don't have enough satisfaction with the assignment.
